# Project Exam 2: Holidaze

Welcome to Project Exam 2 – Holidaze, my final exam project in the second year of the Front-end Development program at Noroff. This project is a front-end booking website called Holidaze where users can search through venues made by oneself and others, book venues and create/update/delete venues. The application is built using **React**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**, and TypeScript.
